<span style="color:orange">***Java Polymorphism***</span>

In java polymorphism will be divided into 2 parts.

* compile/static time polymorphism
* Runtime/Dynamic polymorphism

static polymorphism :

1. Method overloading
2. It uses compile-time binding
3. Method invoked is based on the reference type

dynamic polymorphism :

1. Method Overriding
2. it uses late binding or runtime binding.
3. Method Invoked based on the object type.

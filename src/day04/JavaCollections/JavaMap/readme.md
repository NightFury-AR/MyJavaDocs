## Map

A map is a data structure which supports the key-value pair mapping for the data. This interface doesnâ€™t support duplicate keys because the same key cannot have multiple mappings. A map is useful if there is a data and we wish to perform operations on the basis of the key.

Difference between HashMap and Hash Table


| HashMap   | HashTable | 
|-----------|:-----------:|
|HashMap is non synchronized.It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code. | Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.|
|HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.	| Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value.|
|HashMap is a new class introduced in JDK 1.2. | Hashtable is a legacy class.|
|HashMap is fast. | Hashtable is slow.|
|We can make the HashMap as synchronized by calling this code
   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap); |	Hashtable is internally synchronized and can't be unsynchronized.|
|HashMap is traversed by Iterator.	| Hashtable is traversed by Enumerator and Iterator.|
|Iterator in HashMap is fail-fast.	| Enumerator in Hashtable is not fail-fast.|
| HashMap inherits AbstractMap class. |	Hashtable inherits Dictionary class. |
